---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automatic Scheduling with 9-Hour Minimum (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can set preferred clock-in time and system automatically handles clock-in/out with 9-hour minimum

### Recommendation & incremental tasks

Recommendation: keep the ScheduleConfig UI and schedule editing in the renderer (React), but add a small set of backend (Tauri) APIs to persist schedules securely and enable a future migration of the scheduler execution into the Tauri backend. This gives a fast, low-risk win (secure schedule persistence + UI wiring) while leaving the larger, production-grade backend scheduler as a planned follow-up.

The following tasks implement that recommendation. They are split into a small, fast path (persist & wire the UI) and a longer-term migration path (move execution to Tauri).

- [x] T090 [US2] Implement Tauri schedule persistence commands `get_schedule` and `set_schedule` in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` and wire them to the existing storage backend (`src-tauri/src/storage.rs`). These commands should accept/return a JSON string representing the schedule config. ‚úÖ
- [x] T091 [US2] Add schedule persistence wrappers in `src/services/storage-service.ts`: `saveSchedule(schedule)` / `loadSchedule()` that call the new Tauri commands with a `localStorage` fallback. ‚úÖ
- [x] T092 [US2] Update `src/components/ScheduleConfig.tsx` to use `saveSchedule` / `loadSchedule` so the UI persists to secure storage, and add a small success/failure notification in the component. ‚úÖ
- [x] T093 [US2] Integrate `ScheduleConfig` into `App.tsx` (mount the component behind a menu or settings route) so users can edit and save schedules (this completes T046 as the UI is wired to persistent storage). ‚úÖ

Longer-term (recommended migration - lower priority but production-ready):

- [x] T094 [US2] Implement a backend scheduler in Tauri: add `start_scheduler` / `stop_scheduler` commands and an in-process scheduler that reads persisted schedules and performs clock-in/out operations. ‚úÖ
- [x] T095 [US2] Add eventing and notifications from Tauri to the renderer: expose status events (e.g., `scheduler.started`, `scheduler.clock_in.succeeded`, `scheduler.clock_out.failed`) and add native notifications and persistent logs in `src-tauri`. ‚úÖ

**Phase 4.5: Scheduler Architecture Consolidation (Priority: P1)**

Following successful completion of T094/T095, consolidate dual scheduler implementations to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

- [x] T097 [US2] Simplify App.tsx navigation: consolidate "Backend Scheduler" and "Auto Schedule" tabs into unified "üìÖ Auto Schedule" tab that combines schedule configuration with backend scheduler controls. ‚úÖ
- [x] T099 [US2] Deprecate frontend ScheduleManager: mark `src/services/schedule-service.ts` as deprecated and update components to use backend scheduler exclusively via Tauri commands. ‚úÖ
- [x] T101 [US2] Clean up redundant code: remove unused frontend scheduling logic, duplicate type definitions, and obsolete timer-based implementations while preserving manual clock functionality. ‚úÖ
- [ ] T102 [US2] Integration testing: verify end-to-end backend scheduler functionality including schedule persistence, automatic execution, event emission, and manual override capabilities.

**Phase 4.6: Simplified Auto-Flow Implementation (Priority: P1)**

Based on updated requirements for ultra-simple user experience: setup once, then fully automatic daily operation. **Priority: Remove advanced mode and move auto-startup to backend.**

- [x] T104 [Simplify] Create simplified main status UI: replace complex tabs with single status screen showing current state and countdown timer. ‚úÖ
- [x] T105 [Simplify] Hide schedule configuration: move existing schedule UI to advanced/settings section, focus main UI on status display. ‚úÖ
- [x] T106 [Simplify] Implement app startup auto-clock-in logic: check attendance status on launch and automatically clock in if eligible (not same day, not rest day, not on leave). ‚úÖ
- [x] T107 [Backend] Remove advanced mode completely: eliminate advanced mode toggle from App.tsx and simplify to single status screen with emergency manual override only. ‚úÖ
- [x] T108 [Backend] Move auto clock-in to backend: migrate auto-startup logic from frontend useAutoStartup hook to backend scheduler initialization for better reliability. ‚úÖ
- [x] T109 [Backend] Update StatusScreen for pure display: remove auto-startup integration from frontend component, make it display-only with emergency manual controls. ‚úÖ

**Phase 4.6.1: Token Management & Skip Setup (Priority: P1)**

Based on user feedback for seamless token management and setup skip functionality.

- [x] T109.1 [Auth] Implement token-aware app routing: check for stored refresh_token on startup and skip setup screen if found. ‚úÖ
- [ ] T109.2 [Auth] Add automatic token refresh during clock operations: refresh tokens before each API call and save new tokens.
- [ ] T109.3 [Auth] Update backend auto clock-in to include token refresh: ensure tokens are refreshed and saved during automatic operations.
- [ ] T109.4 [Auth] Add token refresh to gap detection: when wake detection triggers auto clock-in, refresh and save tokens.
- [ ] T109.5 [Frontend] Update App.tsx routing logic: implement token check to determine whether to show setup or status screen.

**Phase 4.6.2: Storage-First Token Management Implementation (Priority: P1)**

Based on plan requirements for consistent token refresh across all operations and the scenario: "Clock-in check ‚Üí If fails, refresh token ‚Üí Save tokens ‚Üí Retry once".

- [ ] T109.6 [Backend] Modify scheduler structure: Add AppHandle parameter to scheduler API methods (call_clock_in_api, call_clock_out_api, check_auto_startup) to enable storage access for token refresh operations.
- [ ] T109.7 [Backend] Implement storage-first token refresh in scheduler: Replace in-memory token logic with storage-based pattern matching api_manual_clock_in around line 380 in commands.rs. Each scheduler operation should: get refresh_token from storage ‚Üí exchange for new tokens ‚Üí store new tokens ‚Üí use fresh token.
- [ ] T109.8 [Backend] Add comprehensive retry logic with double token refresh: Implement scenario-compliant retry pattern: 1st attempt with fresh token ‚Üí if fails, refresh again ‚Üí save tokens ‚Üí retry once ‚Üí if still fails, return error. This covers the "refresh token ‚Üí save ‚Üí retry once" requirement.
- [ ] T109.9 [Backend] Update attendance API with storage-first pattern: Apply same storage-based token refresh to get_attendance_status_api calls in scheduler, ensuring attendance checking uses fresh tokens with retry logic.
- [ ] T109.10 [Backend] Remove in-memory token management: Clean up scheduler by removing access_token Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>>, set_access_token method, and all in-memory token references to eliminate dual token management.
- [ ] T109.11 [Backend] Update scheduler command interfaces: Modify scheduler commands in commands.rs to pass AppHandle to scheduler methods and remove scheduler.set_access_token calls from manual API commands.
- [ ] T109.12 [Backend] Update background monitoring for storage-first: Remove scheduler.set_access_token calls from initialize_background_monitoring and ensure gap detection uses storage-based token refresh.
- [ ] T109.13 [Backend] Set 9-hour default for automatic operations: Update calculate_expected_clock_out_time to default to 540 minutes (9 hours) for automatic clock-out operations while preserving manual duration controls.
- [ ] T109.14 [Integration] Test storage-first token management: Verify all operations (manual commands, scheduler operations, attendance checking, gap detection) use consistent storage-first pattern with proper token refresh and retry logic.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Tasks T109.6-T109.14 implement the storage-first approach where ALL operations follow the same pattern: storage.retrieve("refresh_token") ‚Üí exchange_refresh_token_api ‚Üí storage.store(new_tokens) ‚Üí API_call
- This eliminates the dual token management issue and ensures consistent behavior between manual commands and scheduler operations
- The retry logic implements the exact scenario: "If clock-in fails ‚Üí Refresh token ‚Üí Save new tokens ‚Üí Retry once ‚Üí If retry fails ‚Üí Do nothing"
- These tasks align with plan.md requirement: "Token refresh: Automatic during all API operations, save new tokens"

**Later: Tray Integration (Phase 4.7)**

- [ ] T110 [Tray] Implement system tray integration: app runs in background, minimize to tray instead of exit, tray icon with status indicator and context menu.
- [ ] T111 [Tray] Window management: close button minimizes to tray, true exit only via tray context menu, restore window on tray click.
- [ ] T112 [Tray] System startup integration: optional auto-launch with Windows startup for truly set-and-forget operation.
- [ ] T113 [Tray] Final UI polish: streamline interface to show only essential status information and emergency manual controls.

Notes:

- The T090‚ÄìT093 path is low-risk and quick: it only touches the storage surface and renderer wiring. It is sufficient to mark schedules as persisted and visible to users immediately.
- The T094‚ÄìT095 path is recommended for production: moving timers and network side-effects to the backend improves reliability (survives renderer reloads), allows native notifications, and centralizes retry/backoff and logging.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - manual operations + automation

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Date-Based Logging and History (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can view organized logs of all clock activities, skipped days, and errors

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - API-Based Rest Day and Leave Detection (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: System automatically detects rest days and leave days via EMAPTA attendance API before clock operations

**Independent Test**: System checks attendance API, detects "Rest Day" or "On leave" status, skips operations and logs appropriately

- [ ] T059 [US4] Extend API client to support EMAPTA attendance status endpoint
- [ ] T060 [US4] Create attendance status checking function with API response parsing
- [ ] T061 [US4] Add attendance status interfaces in src/types/api.ts for EMAPTA response format

- [ ] T067 [US4] Add JSDoc documentation to all US4 functions
- [ ] T068 [US4] Update logging service to include skip reasons from API

**Checkpoint**: Smart skipping system functional - detects rest/leave days automatically

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Timezone Handling and Mobile Interface (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Mobile-friendly interface with proper timezone handling for accurate scheduling

**Independent Test**: Use app on mobile device, travel to different timezone, see correct schedule adjustment

- [ ] T088 Create user manual/quickstart guide
- [ ] T089 Final constitutional compliance check (TypeScript, Biome, naming conventions)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) OR sequentially by priority
  - P1 (US1) ‚Üí P2 (US2, US3) ‚Üí P3 (US4, US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses US1's auth/clock services but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Logs US1/US2 operations but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US2's scheduling but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Improves all UIs but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Components marked [P] can be developed in parallel (different files)
- Services must be completed before components that depend on them
- Hooks created after services they wrap
- Integration tasks after individual components are complete
- JSDoc documentation concurrent with implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational completes, user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each story, [P] tasks can run simultaneously
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch components in parallel:
Task T024: "Create TokenSetup component in src/components/TokenSetup.tsx"
Task T025: "Create ClockControls component in src/components/ClockControls.tsx"

# Then services (may depend on types from foundation):
Task T026: "Implement authentication service in src/services/auth-service.ts"
Task T027: "Implement clock service in src/services/clock-service.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test token setup and manual clock operations
5. Deploy/demo if ready - immediate value for manual clock management

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Manual token + clock operations (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Automatic scheduling with 9-hour rule
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Complete activity logging and history
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Smart rest/leave day detection

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completion:

- Developer A: User Story 1 (MVP foundation)
- Developer B: User Story 2 (automation)
- Developer C: User Story 3 (logging)
- Stories integrate naturally due to well-defined interfaces
