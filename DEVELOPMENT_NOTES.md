# Development Notes

**Session Date:** 2025-01-09
**Focus:** Storage-First Token Management Refinement

## 📝 Current Session Work
<!-- Update this section each time you start working -->

**Working On:**
- Completing storage-first token management across all operations (T109.6-T109.14)

**Goals:**
- [ ] Eliminate in-memory token management in scheduler
- [ ] Ensure all API calls use storage-first pattern
- [ ] Update scheduler commands to pass AppHandle for storage access

## 🚧 Active Issues/Blockers
<!-- Add any problems you encounter -->

*None currently - add issues as they arise*

## ✅ Completed Today
<!-- Track daily progress -->

- Set up efficient context system for Claude sessions
- Created PROJECT_STATUS.md and dev-status script

## 🔍 Key Insights/Decisions
<!-- Document important architectural decisions or discoveries -->

- **Storage-First Pattern**: All operations should follow `storage.retrieve("refresh_token") → exchange → storage.store(new_tokens) → API_call`
- **Consistent Retry Logic**: "Attempt → if fails → Refresh → Retry once → if still fails → Return error"
- **Backend Reliability**: Scheduler operations must survive frontend reloads

## 🎯 Next Steps
<!-- What to work on next -->

1. Review current token management in scheduler.rs lines 100-250
2. Update scheduler methods to accept AppHandle parameter
3. Replace in-memory token logic with storage-first pattern
4. Test all operations use consistent token refresh

## 📚 Useful Code Locations
<!-- Reference key files and line numbers -->

- **Token Management Pattern**: `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` lines 373-396 (api_manual_clock_in)
- **Scheduler Structure**: `src-tauri/src/scheduler.rs` lines 94-234
- **Storage Backend**: `src-tauri/src/storage.rs`
- **Frontend Token Logic**: `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`

## 🐛 Known Bugs
<!-- Track bugs that need fixing -->

*None currently tracked - add as discovered*

## 💡 Future Improvements
<!-- Ideas for later implementation -->

- System tray integration for true background operation
- Native notifications for clock events
- Auto-launch with system startup
- Enhanced error recovery and logging
